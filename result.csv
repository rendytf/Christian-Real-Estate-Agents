After finishing High School I went to The University of Southern California where I met my wife Jennifer and earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in English.  I currently live in Aliso Viejo with my wife and three daughters.  It is wonderful working and living in my hometown.  The area has changed a lot over the years but it is still a wonderful place to raise a family and a great place to own Real Estate.

After College I worked in Commercial Finance for three years before getting a job with First American Title Insurance as a Title examiner and Title Plant Supervisor.  In 2002 I was hired by Orange Coast Title as a Sales Representative until 2006 when I went to work full selling homes as a Real Estate Agent.    I believe that my experience in corporate sales, Corporate Lending, as well as my experience in Real Estate Title insurance has given me a unique advantage as a Realtor.  I have a strong understanding of the entire closing process which I’m able to share with my clients.  My years of corporate training have enforced the ideals of good service and communication.    It’s my goal to provide legendary service to everyone I come in contact with, including my fellow Realtors.

In 2007 the National Real Estate market began a steady decline.  As result of our declining real estate market buying and selling foreclosures and short sales has become a consistent part of day to day work.  I’m a certified short sale expert, and a member or REOMAC (a trade organization comprised of Banks, Servicers, Out sourcers, and Real Estate Experts) which strive to continue their training and dialogue concerning the recent foreclosure epidemic.     I’m a member of the National Association of Realtors and the California Association of Realtors.  I attend continuing education at the Local Real Estate Association whenever possible and I make great efforts to incorporate technology into my business.  A more efficient business gives me more time to help my clients."

As a son of a military veteran, I spent 8 years living in Germany through high school graduation.  After returning from Germany, I continued my education at Hampton University and later at University of Phoenix graduating with a bachelor’s degree in business management.   My experience growing up in Europe allows me to build lasting relationships, connect and communicate with people from all backgrounds. 

I have called Southern California his home for the last 18 years.  I purchased my first home, a triplex, at 26 years old and real estate has been my passion ever since. Managing the triplex gave me experience in residential property management, landlord/tenant laws, property maintenance and wide-ranging customer service skills. 

While owning and managing my own property, I was given the opportunity to gain experience in real estate investing, rehabbing, and flipping houses.  This valuable experience led me to learn the financing side of real estate.  I worked for 5 years as a mortgage loan officer and mortgage account executive for the U.S. branch of Hong Kong Shanghai Bank. 

After learning and working in the mortgage banking field, I received my real estate license and went back to my roots as a property manager and successfully managed several large apartment communities in Southern California.  

As a real estate agent I have a passion for making sure the community is well versed in the real estate market, real estate financing, and pre-developed land investing.  I work with a network of top professionals in the Southern California real estate community who are a big part of my clients' successes.  

I am blessed to have two wonderful women in my life, my wife and daughter, who support me in my love for helping others in real estate.  In my spare time, I enjoy, cooking, golfing, scuba diving, traveling, and watching comedies...I love to laugh!"

98% of Jessica's business is by referral with a strong focus on B2B.

One thing remains clear, her intuitive approach to business & emphasis on transparency is the key to helping her clients reach their goals.

Here is a more in-depth look into her history.

A California native, she grew up in a small town in Southern Utah, returning to her roots of Orange County where she began her career in mortgage and real estate and thus began her career in the industry, developing her experience in loan processing & loan origination. Her ability to walk her clients through the process of creating a financial strategy to minimize debt was of clear value to her clients and she quickly became a top producer through her referrals.

From 2007-2009 she entered into the REO market. This natural transition from a process oriented background gave her the foundation to accumulate a vast level of experience with the top REO broker in Orange County, closing close to 100 foreclosure listings within those two short years.

In 2009 as the market transitioned to short sales, so did she. This natural progression, utilizing her process oriented approach, lead her to develop a short sale department for a small bankruptcy firm, generating an additional $125,000 a year in overlooked income. 

She continues to mentor agents & consult for attorneys, specializing in referrals including bankruptcy, divorce, probate, short sale, trust and REO.

And I am your licensed real estate Broker/Agent in California. You’re looking to purchasing a home or selling one, which is one of the biggest life changes that I have personally experienced. You need someone to take the stress off your shoulders and do all the hard and tedious work, and this is where I come in.
I have had the pleasure of helping over 200 families buy homes (63% of the 200+ transactions) as well as sell homes (representing 37% of the 200+ transactions). You have other things to worry and focus on in life and the paperwork and process that is involved in homebuying/selling will stress out just about anyone that hasn’t done this hundreds of times.
My coverage area includes the desert area of Desert Hot Springs, Palm Springs, Palm Desert, Hemet , San Jacinto, and Yucca Valley. For my beach friends, my areas also includes Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.
I will work extremely hard to get you your dream home or sell the one you are in now. I have had the honor of having HomeLight, Zillow, and Redfine rank me one of the top 90% of agents in California for successfully selling homes and as one of the top 10 agents who are able to successfully complete transactions at 98%.
When looking for someone to help you make this next big step in life, choose someone who has been in your shoes and wants nothing but the best for you and your family."

With responsibility for all day-to-day operations of a thriving mortgage banking office, Nathaniel’s goal is to make sure systems and procedures worked smoothly and efficiently to provide clients with the best possible outcome. While he believes in maximizing technology to streamline operations and improve efficiency, it is interacting one-on-one with clients, identifying their needs, and developing a customized solution to their problems that brings him the greatest job satisfaction. He wants people to know that they are not just clients for today, but family for life.  
Nathaniel began his career in the mortgage business 11 years ago and has been with Catalyst for 10 of those, working his way up from client liaison. He was drawn to the mortgage industry because he saw it as career path that would allow him to help people and contribute to his community. His focus is on the individual rather than the sale, on the long-term perspective rather than the quick payoff. 
Nathaniel is an active volunteer with the Active 20/30 Club of Sacramento, an organization of men in their 20s and 30s dedicated to forming lifelong friendships and helping the youth of the Sacramento region. Completing the CAMB Future Leaders Program in 2015 and continuing is his Real Estate Role. He has been part of CanTree for SAR and now part of the SAR Leadership Academy for 2019. He is committed to personal fitness and loves to exercise, eat healthfully, and give back to his community.  
Nathaniel is a now a Realtor with RE/Max Gold of Fair Oaks since the beginning 2018. Looking to expand his knowledge in Real Estate by involving himself within the community and looking further to a State/National basis. Always looking to give back; he now donates (per transaction) to the Children’s Miracle Network who donates 100% of their proceeds. There is no challenge to small or too big to handle."

Enthusiastic, dedicated, honest, energetic, caring – the list of accolades from colleges and past clients is never-ending. 
Since 1986, I have helped hundreds of families realize their dream of owning real estate in Orange County. It is a passion for me. I have lived in the OC since 1965. This is where I have raised a family, run my business and performed volunteer work for a variety of charities.
My unique strengths lie in my love of Orange County and area knowledge as well as how much I care for my clients. In today/s digital world, buyers and sellers have a wealth of information at their finger tips, so then why do so many people turn to me for help? 
Every home sale or purchase is unique and must be valued and handled accordingly. Get it wrong, and buyers could be deterred, and sellers might not get the top market value for their home. Not being aware and informed could mean that buyers could miss the best buy in the neighborhood. I turn information into viable knowledge that helps my clients make educated decisions plus it gives them options that they might not have considered.   
Over the past 30 years of working to serve people with real estate needs and wants, I have witnessed many shifts in the market. At each turn, I have updated my knowledge to stay abreast of market trends, financing and the best strategies to serve my clients.   
I not only earned my broker’s license, I have also earned professional designations that help me to help others – such as the CDPE [Certified Distressed Property Expert], the SFR [Short Sales and Foreclosure Resource], CRS [Certified Residential Specialist], CRB [Certified Residential Brokerage], SRES [Senior Real Estate Specialist] NAR’s Green designation, the Smart Home Technology Certification.

Armed with a degree in Economics from UCI, I first worked as a Financial Analyst for the Defense Industry for many years. I later transitioned to the Mortgage industry, and held positions such as: Loan Officer, Client Specialist, Modifications Specialist, and Underwriter Auditor.  

Working as a Modifications Specialist I helped people who were unable to make their mortgage payments and who were at risk of foreclosure.  I was pretty good at it. I travelled nationwide to provide counseling and loan modifications, and handled escalated files from the Attorney General, Members of Congress, and attorneys –winning recognition for the most closed files.

It was rewarding to help families at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure, and now it’s satisfying to help families find and qualify for their dream home.  Home buyers and sellers appreciate that I’m a skilled negotiator especially when there are multiple offers on a home, or they need to sell their home fast, and for the best price.

Buying or selling a home is often the biggest financial transaction a family will make.  It means the world to me that people trust me to help them through this important life decision.  I use my financial experience to alleviate any stress caused by the financial aspect of transaction, and my knowledgeable staging skills to help my clients sell their homes quickly for the best price.

I’m a proud wife of a retired police officer of 38 years, and mother of two adult sons.  As a stay-at- home mom I had a home business as a piano instructor.  I still play the piano, and have now combined my love of music with dance by learning to dance the Hula.

""Practicing the Fine Art of Real Estate""

I have over 30 years experience facilitating the acquisition and sale of fine homes. Together with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Santa Barbara’s leading residential brokerage firm, I can provide you with the best real estate services available.

Berkshire Hathaway's local, national, and global reach is extraordinary. No one knows the Santa Barbara real estate market quite like Berkshire Hathaway's professionals do. We live here, we work here, and thrive here. In conjunction with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services I am able to provide my clients with an unparalleled view of the latest market conditions, and a comprehensive suite of services to ensure every possible success. I bring to this process extensive local knowledge regarding the various neighborhoods throughout southern Santa Barbara.

As a skilled advisor I am adept at merging the needs of both buyer and seller into effective agreements. By blending old school real estate strategies with the newest technologies I can give you an edge up on the competition, especially if you're considering selling your home here.

If you're thinking of buying a home here in Santa Barbara, part of my focus includes providing you with information on ""off market"" homes that are not formally listed on the MLS or online. I know the neighborhoods. I know this market, and the opportunities therein.

Prior to entering real estate sales I created ads for a large advertising company in San Francisco and Marin County, I also have extensive experience in professional photography, videography (real estate videos), and internet marketing.
I'm tenacious when it comes to com
municating. My pledge is excellent communication at every step in the process. My focus is on maximizing your results for a truly rewarding real estate experience.

Santa Barbara offers a wide array of different architectural styles and I enjoy working with all of them! When working with sellers I take great pride in using my expertise, resources, and global connections to unite extraordinary places with extraordinary people who will cherish them. After all, there are few places more important than the one you call home.

Integrity, professionalism, service, and professional standards - a reputation I've earned by helping people effectively and fairly for over 30 years.

A former Vice President of Marketing for a multi-million dollar sales organization, I utilize my marketing skills and creative talents and abilities in every aspect of real estate sales.

I was raised in a traditional home where high moral standards, including honesty and integrity, were greatly cherished. I serve my clients by combining those same high standards in business.

I take a PROACTIVE approach to real estate, but never high pressured, consulting with home buyers and sellers to identify their unique requirements and goals.  Proper real estate planning aong with utilizing the advice of financial and legal professionals is crucial to helping clients better manage their real estate assets.

Buying or selling a home is both an emotional and a business decision.  My clients appreciate working with a real estate professional who will develop a strategy for helping them buy and sell real estate based on sound business principles.  Homebuyers and sellers have the reliability of my 25 years in the corporate business world and 20+ years of real estate experience and knowledge working for them!

No transaction is too large or too small to get my fullest attention. I sell properties ranging from luxury estates to condominiums and investment properties in the South Bay/Palos Verdes area.  My clients are diverse, from first time homebuyers,  women in transition, corporate relocation, celebrities, and seniors moving into retirement communities.

I've earned the loyalty and respect of my homebuyers and sellers by striving to protect their best interests while keeping their confidentiality.  As a trusted advisor, I never lose sight of the fact that straightforward honesty and accountability are what clients expect from me.  It's this kind of relationship that not only meets, but also exceeds their expectations and leads to a long-term business association.

I work with Residential Real Estate, both new and existing, and have been serving the Roseville area since 1990. I hold a variety of professional designations including Certified Residential Specialist.

Although my office is in Roseville, my practice often takes me to Sacramento, El Dorado and Yolo Counties. My efforts are split equally between marketing homes and helping buyers find that perfect home.

You can check out several sites where Clients have posted Reviews: Yelp, Yahoo and Google+. Video reviews can be found on YouTube as well as marketing videos I’ve done for some of my sellers.

I received my BS from Kansas State University (Go Wildcats!), in Bakery Science & Business Management. That is where I found that Marketing & Advertising was a passion of mine … one of the things that I bring to the table that is particularly important to Sellers.

The first part of my career was spent in eastern Kansas working as a Broker Associate. I loved helping families buy and sell their homes, much as I do here in California today. The Midwest and high plains are my roots and I carry the work ethic associated with that heritage to this day.

Buying or selling a home is a very personal endeavor. I treat all clients with professionalism delivered in a very personal way. Although my passion is the creative aspect of marketing and merchandising homes for sellers, close to half of my business comes from working with buyers. I believe that is because advertising great homes brings great buyers that respond to my personal approach.

Because I invest the largest share of my time delivering first class service to those who hire me, little time is expended trying to obtain business from the general public. You will receive my undivided attention and the dedication to the detail that my customers and clients have come to expect. What that means to you is the highest possible level of service from me. In response to this, I request your heartfelt endorsement to family, friends and work associates. I am interested in building strong, lasting relationships based on your excellent experience.

When I’m not helping clients with their real estate needs, I love hot air ballooning, skydiving, photography and traveling with my wife.

I worked 15 years in this capacity  managing over 500 Million dollars in assets for small business owners 
and high net worth clients all throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. My main responsibility was to help my clients grow their assets and businesses. 

For years I helped the wealthy diversify and  increase their assets through investments in real estate and securities.  It wasn't  until I took a job as a Branch 
Manager for a bank in an area where my client base was living from paycheck to paycheck  that I realized the great need to expand my expertise in real estate and 
investments to people who did not know smart ways of how to build their wealth and work towards financial independence

I found that this group of people needed my help the most.  There are so many people who have dreams of owning a own home, sending their children to college and retiring comfortably, but have no idea how to make that a reality for themselves.  I also discovered that most financial institutions/professionals did not consider this an audience to target for business.

 I gained a lot of  helpful experience from working as a financial planner that I now use to run a successful company today.

Since the inception of my companies I have expanded my knowledge of real estate in the area of foreclosures and REO's (BankOwned).  I have spent the last 8 years assisting clients with the purchase and sale of these 
properties.  This new avenue has been a rewarding experience and very beneficial in the growth of my company.

Whether you’re buying or selling, you need someone with the type of experience I can offer.  

I am not only a licensed Realtor, but I have also been a local Real Estate Appraiser for decades. My interest in real estate started when I moved to the Bay Area from Minnesota (after a short detour in New York!) almost 30 years ago. It was shortly after purchasing my first home that I became interested in real estate valuation.  

As a Real Estate Appraiser, I have the education and experience to help you find the right home. I can spot issues that others may be unaware of, and since I know what lenders will approve, I have the expertise to navigate situations before they occur.  

Additionally, if you are a seller, these same skills benefit you. I have knowledge and experience in Santa Clara County, as well as neighboring counties.  

On a personal note, I am also your neighbor in the Cambrian area of San Jose. I have lived in the Cambrian area with my two children and husband since 1997, and previously resided in Almaden Valley, Cupertino and Sunnyvale.

I left Minnesota in 1986 to become a Flight Attendant for American Airlines, and have always had a passion for the sky.  That is why I became a private licensed pilot in approximately 1990.  

After building a successful real estate appraisal business, I realized that I could make a difference to my neighbors, and the families around me, by helping navigate the often eclectic Silicon Valley real estate market. My attention to detail and perseverance cause my clients to rave about working with me.

When she was 5 years old her parents moved their family from the Bay Area to Incline Village, Nevada on the north shore of Tahoe. There, she attended school through high school and was active in many competitive sports including skiing and tennis, and ski raced at the regional and national level through college.   

As a graduate of the University of Colorado, Boulder, Sproehnle has spent virtually all of her life in the mountains. She was drawn back to North Lake Tahoe after college, where she began a career in graphic design and marketing. Shortly after, she and her husband Rob, lifelong resident of Squaw Valley and another ski racer, married and started their family. 
Together with her husband as a builder, Sproehnle is a partner in the couple’s general contracting business, where she has gained years of experience in construction. She leverages this background, as well as her connections in the trades, to offer additional value to her clients.

Sproehnle loves spending time with her husband and two daughters, one who attends the local high school and the other, the University of Oregon. She is passionate about education and has volunteered countless hours at local schools and for the Tahoe Truckee Excellence in Education Foundation. An avid outdoor enthusiast, Sproehnle has sailed extensively on Tahoe and in the Bay Area, has coached skiing and soccer, and enjoys hiking with the family’s four-legged sidekick Mac, as well as skiing, cooking, and curling up with a good crossword puzzle.

Her extensive knowledge of the unique neighborhoods and communities of the area, plus her marketing prowess and practical understanding of new home construction and remodeling are an effective blend in connecting buyers and sellers in the Tahoe/Truckee market. 

Sproehnle is extremely proud to be part of the Sierra Sotheby’s International Realty team."

Helping people get the keys to their new home makes me so proud and drives everything I do.
If you are looking for a Realtor, who hears you, guides you through the process and protects your best interest , I'd love to work with you.
When I am not serving people I am spending time with my family, cooking up a favorite meal, or out on the boat.
Want to learn more how we can work together? Call or text me anytime.
Thanks for reading my story.
